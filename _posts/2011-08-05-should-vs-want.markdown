title: I Should … vs I want …

This morning I noticed myself thinking “I should write a blog post.  I should work on my projects.”  Somewhere behind that was another thought “but I don’t feel like it …”

When I became conscious of this inner conflict between want and should it inspired me to write a blog post.  Now I’m doing what I should be doing and actually feel like doing it too.

I think this nicely illustrates the power of consciousness and inspiration to make us happier.

What are the “should”s in your life that you don’t feel like doing?  Try to clear the list by upgrading them to “wants” or downgrading them to “not worth feeling bad about” and this may clear your mind enough that something inspiring will come along.
