On my journey of self-discovery I have been puzzling over who my "authentic self" really is - and how will I know
when I'm "being myself authentically"?

Recently I saw don Miguel Ruiz speaking on Operah and he said something that really struck me - basically he said
that nobody knows their authentic self, and probably nobody ever will.

It dawned on me that I cannot really <b>know</b> my true self completely.  I can <b>be</b> authentic
from moment to moment by not repressing my feelings, desires, and thoughts.  But to truly know myself is too much.
I'll never be able to encompass all there is to know.  I'll never know how I will react in every possible situation.
Through my life I get to know parts of myself when I observe myself in action, how I react and act in
different situations.  I learn what I like by trying things out.  Sometimes something I thought I might like,
I don't like.  Something I used to really dislike, I might try again now and it's okay.

So, I make a guess about who I am, what I like, how I'll act, but it's an educated guess at best.  I could change and
grow without noticing it.

One of the Four Agreements is "Don't Make Assumptions" and often I assume that I am still the same as before, and
that I know myself.  If I let go of that assumption and allow myself to be transform from one moment to the
next without judging or resisting that transformation I can be more authentic.  I won't be trying to live up to my
idea of what my authentic self should be like based on my past experiences.

At some level it is annoying that I can never really know my authentic self.  However, I think working with guesses and
assumptions is good enough for practical purposes, most of the time.  As long as I don't get too upset that I don't
turn out who I thought I would be, things should turn out well in the end.
