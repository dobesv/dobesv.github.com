title: Why I'm Applying at TopTal
---

I recently ran into an interesting sounding company called "TopTal".  I think the name
is short for "Top Talent" but that's just a guess.  For a while I have been thinking 
about where I could some more freelance work at local north american rates.  I prefer to
do everything online, because that's the way I am.  However, normally when
you're looking for freelance work online at sites like UpWork, there are a lot of
people from around the world applying with much lower rates than I'm looking for, and
the clients are usually going there looking for a deal.  So in the past I have basically
had zero success finding gigs on those sites.

TopTal appears to offer full North American pay along with the flexible hours and lifestyle
that I've enjoyed from freelance work in the past, but also with the convenience of an
online marketplace like Upwork.

I think it's relatively low risk to apply, compared to the possible rewards of working with 
and for great people at a competitive rate for the area I live in.  So, I'm giving it a try,
to see what it's really like in there.
