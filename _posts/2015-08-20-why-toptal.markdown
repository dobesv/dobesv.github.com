title: Why I'm Applying at TopTal
---

For a while I have been thinking 
about where I could some more freelance work at local north american rates.  I prefer to
do everything online, because that's the way I am.  However, normally when
you're looking for freelance work online at sites like UpWork, there are a lot of
people from around the world applying at their much lower local rates, and
the clients are usually going there looking for a deal.  I have basically
had zero success finding decent gigs on those sites.

In the past I've found freelancing jobs that pay well only through word of mouth.  Basically,
I know someone who is looking for some extra help and they are willing to hire on a contract
basis instead of as a full time employtee.

I recently ran into an interesting sounding agency called "[TopTal Software Programmers Group](https://www.toptal.com/software)".

They appear to offer full North American pay along with the flexible hours and lifestyle
of freelance work that I like, but also with the convenience of an online marketplace like 
Upwork.  I searched around and read some reviews and generally people are very positive
about their experience working there and they highly recommend it.

I think it's relatively low risk to apply, compared to the possible rewards, so I'm applying today.  Ask me in a few months if you want to know how it all turns out!
