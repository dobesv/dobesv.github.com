title: Cause and Effect as a Limiting Worldview
category: enlightenment
---

Been reading an interesting [article about leadership](http://ssrn.com/abstract=1585976) written by some Landmark people
and I thought some parts of it were interesting enough to excerpt.

Here's a section on cause and effect as a limiting world view.

> A present day (and therefore more difficult to see) example of a constraining
> worldview is most people’s worldview of “cause/effect”.  Most of us believe that
> whatever we encounter has been caused by something.  This aspect of our worldview
> makes unintelligible for many of us any non-cause/effect phenomenon.
>
> A scientifically verified  example of a non-cause/effect phenomenon is
> “entanglement”.  This is the name given by quantum physicists to the instantaneous
> invariant non-cause/effect correlation of the states of a certain two particles (quanta)
> that come into contact and are later at a distance from one another.  “No matter how
> far they move apart, if one  is tweaked, measured, observed, the other seems to
> instantly respond, even if the whole world now lies between them.”
>
> Given our non-physicist’s  worldview (model of reality) that everything we
> encounter is caused by something, we would like to say that the state of the one
> particle causes the effect of the state of the other particle.  However, this cannot be
> true because when measured the two particles are at a distance from one another and
> the responsive result is instantaneous. Because this responsive result is instantaneous
> at a distance, the connection cannot be  a cause/effect connection. Instantaneous
> action at a distance as a cause/effect phenomenon would violate the  experimentally
> established limit of the speed of light as the absolute maximum rate of transfer of
> information from one location to another (that is, something being the effect of some
> cause must happen within the speed of light).
