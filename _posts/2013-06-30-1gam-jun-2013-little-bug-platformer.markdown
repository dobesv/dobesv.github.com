title: "June's One Game A Month Release: Hop, Little Bug, Hop!"

For June, Glenn and I made a platformer based on the same character from
"Fly, Little Bug, Fly!" we made in March.  In this one you are wrapped in cobwebs
that prevent you from flying, but apparently you can still hop around!  So
it's called "Hop, Little Bug, Hop!"
