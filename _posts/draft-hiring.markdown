I've hired a number of people over the years, or helped hire them.  A couple QA people,
a number of engineers, and at some point a CEO for my startup.  It's not bad, but if
you're looking for an expert on hiring this may not be the place to look.  I think this
page is more useful for someone trying to decide if my philosophies around hiring are
compatible with their own, or to just get more of a sense of who I am.

## Be Patient

There really are great candidates out there and if you are trying to build
a great company then patience in finding the best people will pay off.

Note that I'm saying "build a great company".  After reading Good to Great I
realized that it's best to build a great team and not worry too much about the
product.  If you feel like you can't build the team fast enough to get some
particular product to market, you're not thinking "company first, product second"

If you're just trying to build a great product then keep in mind that you're doing
is a short-term play - you might as well hire contractors (ideally ones working
at a great company) to build the product.  Investors won't like this because
"all contractors" means you're not building a great team and company, just a
product, and that's a lot less likely to deliver huge returns.  By trying to hire
great employees you can make it <b>look<b> like you are trying to build a great
company... but if you're doing this in a hurry the underlying truth is that you're
focused more on getting it out the door.

## Be Picky

If you allow less than stellar candidates into the team then good people will leave or not
refer your team due to the presence of mediocrity.  You won't develop a reputation as the
place where only the best people are working.

So, be picky in who you hire.

## Alignment Over Skills

You should consider that alignment with the company's (yours if you are the leader) ideology,
values, culture, mission, and so on.  Many roles do require some basic skills, but don't fuss
about whether a programmer knows the exact programming language and database software you are
using if they seem like a perfect match in the other areas.

Set a reasonable minimum on technical skills and rank by alignment.  Getting a perfect match
on skills is a bonus.

## Trial Period

I've heard that 37 signals, cdbaby, and others use the [trial period](http://www.answers.com/topic/probationary-employment-periods) approach with great success.
The concept is to hire someone on a contract or internship basis at first to do some work
together before "tying" the knot with an full employment contract.

This can allow you to have a more lightweight interview process, or skip the interview
altogether, although it may seem tiresome to return to the job market if someone seems
"good enough" after doing a project.

## Core concepts for interview questions

* Focus on asking questions and don't worry about sticking to the script
* Dig deeper behind the answers you get
* Have some technical questions to test skill
* Have some questions around values and team fit
* It's better to ask "what did you do" than "what would you do", as people do not
  give accurate predictions about their own behavior, especially during interviews.

## Be sure to filter your list of questions and remove the ones that are not helpful

* Don't ask questions that you yourself couldn't reasonably answer - test the questions on yourself
* Don't ask questions where the "right" answer is completely obvious - i.e. "are you a hard worker?",
  "do you believe in integrity?", "do you like money?"

## Example interview questions

* Give an example of a time when you apologized.
* Give an example of a time when you failed to meet a commitment.
