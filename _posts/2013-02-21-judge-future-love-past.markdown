I recently had a realization that judgement and criticism are not, as I had previously thought, all bad.  They have
a place, I think, and that place is in planning for the future.  The past and present are already decided - we all
did our best and got what we got; love, accept, and choose the present and the past.

However, when looking to the future you have to make choices, and those choices are based on judgement and critical
thinking.  That's where you get to pick favorites and love some options and reject others.

Just remember, once the consequences of those future choices have been settled, and you either got what you wanted,
what you planned for, or you didn't -- love, accept, and choose those consequences as the perfect results of the
choices made by you and everyone else doing their best, loving themselves and each other.
