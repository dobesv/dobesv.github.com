What wizards do isn't real magic.  Real magic means mystery and wonderment.  It tells a story,
delights an audience.  There's not much magic to casting spells and blowing things up, once you
really get down to it.  It's about as magical as using a hammer.

No, creating real magic is the work of a magician.  A magician provides a carefully crafted
experience of wonder and magic and leaves his audience in a state of awe.  No explosions and
nobody gets hurt.  Well, most of the time.

Did I ever mention that my magician's training was quite physically demanding?  My grandfather,
who raised me and taught me almost everything I know, loved to push the limits of how big and
dangerous a trick could be.  Once while making three large lions disappear in a puff of smoke,
a yappy poodle from the audience escaped its owner and attacked the lions.

It turns out the poodle, who was a favorite of a high-up in a local gang, didn't fare well in
the ensuing moments.  Escaping the city in one piece was a matter of climbing, leaping,
sprinting, and sneaking that would challenge the limits of many an adventuring rogue, but
he pulled it off an lived to tell the story.

I bring this up because it was at this moment that I was quietly thanking him for that training.
