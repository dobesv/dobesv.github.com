# Objectives

My current intention is to use my talents to create things that are useful
for people, and which make a difference for them.

In doing so I will must earn a comfortable standard of living that allows
me to focus my attention on pursuing my interests more so than spend energy
merely surviving and maintaining a lifestyle.

# Maxims

[Integrity](http://ssrn.com/abstract=1511274) is important to me in business as
in all areas of life.  I'm greatly influenced by [Landmark Education]{http://www.landmarkeducation.com/} and by
[The Four Agreements](http://www.toltecspirit.com/) when it comes to understanding and
defining integrity.  When you treat your word with honor and respect anything
is possible.

Freedom is my second maxim - I don't like to control other or be controlled.  I
seek to always have a freedom of choice and to offer others the same.

# Interests

Early my teenage years I started to spend a lot of time doing computer programming.  Starting with
the examples from the BASIC programming book that came with the Commodore 64, then continuing
this as a passion until today by learning a variety of programming languages and tools on several
different operating system.

After that I gained an interest in personal development.  This started with a few books
like "[Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway](http://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Feel_the_fear_and_do_it_anyway.html?id=1Rp-YG9aoP4C&utm_source=gb-gplus-share)"
and "[The Power of Now](http://books.google.com.tw/books/about/The_Power_of_Now.html?id=sQYqRCIhFAMC&utm_source=gb-gplus-share)" but also includes workshops
like [The Landmark Forum](http://www.landmarkeducation.com/),
[The Millionaire Mind Intensive](http://www.millionairemindintensive.com/),
[Dov Baron](http://dovbaron.com/)'s Courses.

Later, I took up an interest in entrepreneurship, starting a company making
[online accounting software](http://www.kashoo.com) which was a modest success
in that it acquired some customers, attracted some investment, and taught me
a lot about my own interests and capabilities in this arena.

All throughout this I've enjoyed video games and had a couple of stints working on
video games, first working on some fun modifications (mods for short) for Quake,
then later working a stint at Rockstar Games Vancouver where they shipped the game
[Bully](http://www.rockstargames.com/bully/)
with a bit of help from yours truly.  I still enjoy playing video games and hope to
make more games in the future.

# History

I was born in Vancouver, BC, Canada and quickly was moved to a nearby town called
[Powell River](http://www.discoverpowellriver.com/) where I spent my childhood
and teenage years.  I spent a lot of time reading books and playing with computers,
which is still how things are today.  Later I moved back to Vancouver to study, work,
and live as my preferred "home base" in life.
